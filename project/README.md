# Project description for UU python course

In RNA sequencing experiments on single cells, RNA molecules are caputured from the cells and processed into complementary DNA or cDNA. These cDNA molecules are then amplified exponentially amplified by a reaction called PCR to generate sufficient concentrations to make the molecules detectable and readable with sequencing instruments.
The data generated from such experiments therefore contain a high fraction of duplicated RNA sequences and have to be demultiplexed to achieve accurate quantification. To do this, a so called Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is coupled to each RNA molecule, making it possible to trace identical PCR copies to one single RNA molecule. In this project, I will present a small simulation framework to benchmark different duplicate removal algorithms and evaluate their performance.
